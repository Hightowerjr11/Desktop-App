# Windscribe Desktop App Contributor's Guide

Please follow this guide for instructions / best practices when reporting issues, proposing new features, and submitting contributions via Pull Requests (PRs).

## Filing an Issue

1. Look for a similar issue that may already exist, including closed issues.

1. If none exists, create a new issue and provide as much description and context as possible.

1. Apply any relevant labels to the issue.

### How to notify the Windscribe devs of an interesting thing to consider for inclusion in the app

Upvote the original issue by clicking its [+üòä] button and hitting üëç (+1) icon or a different one.  This allows us to measure how impactful different issues are compared to others.  Commenting an issue with "+1", "me too", etc. makes it harder to have a conversation and prioritize requests.

## Contributing Fixes or Enhancements

If you are interested in helping to fix an issue and/or implement new features, we'd love your contribution!

When contributing to the Windscribe Desktop App repository, please first discuss the change you wish to make with the Windscribe development team via an issue.  This repository is a mirror of our internal development repository, and is updated only when we make a public release.  Therefore it is possible the development team is already working on, or has completed, this change.  Further, we want to avoid you investing your time in a change that we may not be able to approve for integration into the app.
